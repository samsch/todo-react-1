# Todo app - React
This is a small Todo app.

[Live demo on Github pages](https://samsch.github.io/todo-react-1/)

Built using React and a dev environment boilerplate.

Included features:
- Add new todo item
- Finish item
- Unfinish item
- Edit item
- Delete item
- Client-side Persistance

## Run

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/samsch/todo-react-1.git`
2. Install dependencies and tools `npm install`
3. Run (auto-opens browser window) `npm start`

This is setup to run in HTTPS mode with a self-signed certificate, so your browser will require you to add a security exception. In Chrome and Edge, you only option is to do this per-session. In Firefox, I recommend not adding a permanent exception, since the cert is intentionally short-lived.

### Credits

I used input styles from [Various CSS Input Text Styles](http://callmenick.com/post/various-css-input-text-styles).
